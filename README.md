# Advent of Code
This is most of the years I've done Advent of Code problems piled into one place. This is organized by language first and then year. I have worked with others on a few, noted as comments at the top of the individual days. The Scala set is the most recent and robust and may have some library helper functions that I've written. 

Each language has its own little stylistic goofs - for C# I tried to do everything in a single line absolutely whenever possible, abusing tuples and the Linq dot syntax to write code that would never ever pass real review. Similarly, for the Scala problems I've almost always gone with tail-recursive methods using immutable objects, even when it makes no sense.
